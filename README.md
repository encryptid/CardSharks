# CardSharks
A Card Sharks-style game that uses Sass, vanilla JS, and a "flat"-inspired design.

Planned updates:<br>
--Add a visible ticker for overall wins (JS already keeps track)<br>
--Create or add cards with more of a "flat" style for consistency<br>
--2nd player (alternating) with an option to select mode(1P or 2P)<br>
